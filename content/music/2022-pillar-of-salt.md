On late summer evenings, the gnomes gather near a giant rock salt formation shaped like a boy to tell the tales of old forbidden places. To turn back is dangerous but to remember is vital. Every young gnome must learn that you cannot step in the same river twice.

Original MIDI music inspired by video game soundtracks

Used resources:
- Reaper DAW

    I struggled with how to get started learning music for years. I didn't have the right tools or resources so I wasn't able to get a routine, and I didn't get anywhere.
    
    I finally unlocked some rudimentary skills in late 2022 when my friend recommended Reaper DAW and some Youtube tutorials. I immediately started making this first collection, working on it almost daily for months.
    
    Now in early 2024 these already sound pretty rough to me, but there are things I'm proud of here. Water Level is a jam. I think it's important to make and publish real things as soon as possible rather than waiting until you're ready.
